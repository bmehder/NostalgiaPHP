# NostalgiaPHP Overview

## What is NostalgiaPHP?

NostalgiaPHP is a lightweight site engine that treats your whole website like a folder.

- **Portable** → your entire site is just files; zip it, copy it, push it to GitHub.  
- **Zero-setup deploy** → drop the folder onto a PHP server, and you’re live.  
- **Simple backups** → copy the directory, done. Version control with GitHub is usually enough.  
- **Rapid prototyping** → spin up an idea, deploy, and test in minutes.  
- **Design freedom** → edit templates, CSS, and partials without a framework fighting you.  
- **Future-proof** → if you move to WordPress, Next, or anything else later, you already have your Markdown, styles, and assets.  

It’s for developers who want to **ship real content websites fast** without committing to a heavyweight CMS or framework.
