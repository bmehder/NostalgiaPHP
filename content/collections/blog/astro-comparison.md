# NostalgiaPHP vs Astro

Both are tools for building content-heavy sites.  
Both lean on **files, not databases**.  
But one is caveman simple, and the other is modern meta-framework simple.

---

## 🐘 NostalgiaPHP
- **Markdown or HTML + PHP.** That’s it.  
- **File-based routing.** Pages and collections map directly to the file system.  
- **Zero build step.** No `npm run build`, no `node_modules`.  
- **Instant deploy.** Upload the folder, site goes live.  
- **Portable.** Your project folder *is* the site.  

---

## 🚀 Astro
- **Islands architecture.** HTML by default, sprinkle JS where needed.  
- **File-based routing.** Drop `.astro` files into `src/pages`.  
- **Build step required.** Always needs Node, npm, and a build process.  
- **Integrations galore.** React, Svelte, Vue, Tailwind, Markdown, MDX, etc.  
- **Portable (after build).** You ship the compiled output, not your source.  

---

## ✨ The Similarity
Both say: *“The web is mostly content. Let’s optimize for content.”*  
- Astro ships pure HTML by default.  
- NostalgiaPHP ships pure HTML too — it just skips the compile step.  

---

## 🚀 The Difference
- **NostalgiaPHP** = raw, server-side simplicity. Markdown in, HTML out, no tooling.  
- **Astro** = modern static-site generator + meta-framework. Flexible, but requires a build and an ecosystem.  

---

### TL;DR
If you want **the fastest path from Markdown to website**, without any toolchain:  
👉 *Make site. Files good. Framework bad.* (NostalgiaPHP)  

If you want a **modern static generator with integrations and a plugin ecosystem**:  
👉 *Astro.*
