# The NostalgiaPHP Manifesto

1. **Keep it simple.** If all you need is to show content and sprinkle in a little JavaScript, this is the easiest way I know to publish a site.
1. **Essentials included.** You get a sitemap.xml, robots.txt, a 404 page, and control over SEO basics (titles, meta descriptions, and sitemap inclusion).
1. **Flexible Markdown.** Write plain Markdown, drop in HTML when you need more control, or mix the two inside a file.
1. **Extend with templates.** If Markdown isnâ€™t enough, make a PHP template and reuse partials.
1. **Low-friction workflow.** Develop locally, push to GitHub, and deploy to Render.com (or anywhere with PHP).
1. **Minimal dependencies.** Anything else introduces setup, maintenance, and fragility. Add features only when you actually need them.
1. **Extend outward.** Lean on microservices or language1.agnostic tools (like standalone contact forms) instead of inflating the core.
1. **Easy exit ramp.** If you outgrow this, migrate your styles and content, then rebuild views in another framework or language.
