# NostalgiaPHP vs Ruby on Rails  
*Framework heavyweight meets folder of files.*

## Rails in a Nutshell
- Rails popularized the modern web framework: MVC, migrations, scaffolding, ORM, helpers, asset pipeline, gems, the works.  
- Convention over configuration: you get generators, opinionated folder structures, helpers, and rails-specific idioms.  
- It‚Äôs fantastic if you‚Äôre building a web app with data models, users, authentication, dashboards, and lots of interactions.  
- The tradeoff: complexity. You need Ruby, Bundler, Rails installed. You inherit conventions. You have to learn ‚Äúthe Rails way.‚Äù  

## NostalgiaPHP in a Nutshell
- Not a framework at all. Just plain PHP + folders.  
- Your ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù is Markdown files.  
- Your ‚Äúviews‚Äù are PHP partials and templates.  
- Your ‚Äúroutes‚Äù are basically `index.php` with `if/else`.  
- Deployment = drop the folder on a server that has PHP.  
- Backup = copy the folder.  

It‚Äôs not trying to be Rails lite. It‚Äôs the opposite philosophy: strip away everything until the *files themselves* are the source of truth.

## Key Contrasts

| Dimension        | Rails                                      | NostalgiaPHP                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Setup**        | Install Ruby, Rails, Bundler, configure DB | Upload folder to server with PHP        |
| **Content**      | Database tables & ActiveRecord models       | Markdown files with front-matter        |
| **Architecture** | MVC (models, views, controllers)           | Pages, collections, partials            |
| **Flexibility**  | Tons of plugins (gems)                     | Roll your own partials/templates        |
| **Performance**  | Runs Ruby app server (Puma/Passenger)       | Served directly by Apache/Nginx + PHP   |
| **Scaling**      | Suited for apps with lots of business logic | Suited for content-heavy small sites    |
| **Learning**     | Learn Rails conventions                    | Know PHP basics, Markdown, HTML, CSS    |
| **Deployment**   | Capistrano, Heroku, containerization        | Copy folder to webroot, done            |

## Who They‚Äôre For
- **Rails**: web application developers who need complexity: user accounts, APIs, dashboards, background jobs, scaling.  
- **NostalgiaPHP**: people who want to ship a *website*, not an app. Something closer to ‚Äúdigital documents + light design.‚Äù  

## The Overlap
Ironically, both Rails and NostalgiaPHP were born from the same itch: *stop reinventing the wheel*.  
- Rails said: ‚ÄúWe keep writing the same controllers, migrations, and forms. Let‚Äôs codify them into a framework.‚Äù  
- NostalgiaPHP says: ‚ÄúWe keep writing the same header, footer, and blog loop. Let‚Äôs boil it down to a folder of Markdown and a few PHP files.‚Äù

üëâ So if Rails is a Swiss Army knife with every attachment, NostalgiaPHP is a pocketknife ‚Äî sharp, portable, good enough for most jobs, but not pretending to be a power tool.
