# NostalgiaPHP  

> A file-based CMS for people who survived WordPress and the JavaScript framework wars.  

---

## Why?  

Back in 2004, WordPress was simple:  
- A few PHP files.  
- A database you could actually understand.  
- A `header.php` and `footer.php` you edited right on the server.  

Then the web went sideways:  
- WordPress themes turned into small operating systems.  
- JavaScript discovered frameworks‚Ä¶ then metaframeworks‚Ä¶ then frameworks for those.  
- Suddenly your ‚Äúsimple site‚Äù needed `npm install` and 600MB of dependencies.  

All you wanted was a website.

## What is NostalgiaPHP?  

It‚Äôs **not a framework**.  
It‚Äôs **not a static site generator**.  
It‚Äôs **definitely not WordPress**.  

üëâ It‚Äôs a tiny flat-file CMS that:  
- Uses Markdown files as your database.  
- Routes everything through one `index.php`.  
- Renders with simple templates and partials.  
- Makes URLs pretty with `.htaccess`.  

That‚Äôs it.  

---

## Features  

- Write pages and collections in **Markdown**.  
- Drop in **partials** (`header.php`, `footer.php`).  
- Add **tags** if you feel fancy.  
- No database. No build step. No Node.  
- Runs anywhere PHP runs (which is‚Ä¶ everywhere).

## Installation  

1. Copy the files.  
2. Run `php -S localhost:8000`.  
3. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).  
4. Make pages. Done.

## Philosophy  

- Simple sites deserve simple tools.  
- Markdown first, HTML if you need it.  
- PHP is fine. Stop pretending it isn‚Äôt.  
- If your site needs a build system, you‚Äôre overthinking it.
